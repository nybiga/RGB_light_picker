# RGB_light_picker

This project uses PlatformIO as it's ecosystem.
It uses the serial monitor to take input from the user. The user types in a number from given list and the LED light changes to cooresponding color.

## Tools used

An Arduino compatible board
Breadboard
LED light
Jumper wires(4)

## Design

See RGB_light_picker_circuit.png for circuit design.

### Note

The circuit design uses an Arduino Uno board and the board used for this project was an Arduino Mega so D4 is a PWM pin. Ensure PWM pins are used for better results.

## Physical appearance

See RGB_light_picker.jpg for physical appearance.
See RGB_light_picker.MP4 for to see how it works.
